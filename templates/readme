neurOn compilation templates

Each .cst (c sapa template) file defines allowable fields,
algorithms used, and other aspects used in c source code generation
from the neurOn markup language.

While editing the existing files is one way of re-configuring
the compiler, it is advised to store the default files in a another directory so that they can be recovered easily in the event that a reset is needed.

The directory MUST contain the files:
	bioPlate.cst
	master.cst
	container.cst
in order to compile. If one of these files is missing, or
renamed so that no other file of that name is present, the neurOn
compiler will fail.
Implementing code fields is simple. Fields have some auto-formatting
done by the compiler. Following a method declaration, inline-C code
is added, following at least one tab per line. The first line of
non-blank, non-tabbed code closes the function.

bioPlate.cst------------>
#defines all cell types and neurotransmitters to be used.
A standard API for new cells must be followed, and all required
fields must be implemented for successful compilation.
Additional functions may be added to custom cell types if desired.
